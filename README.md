# bhvr ðŸ¦« ai tool chat

A full-stack TypeScript monorepo starter with shared types, using Bun, Hono, Vite, and React

## Steps

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies for all workspaces
bun install
```

### Environment Setup

#### Server

Set up the environment variables for the server. Wrangler `.dev.vars` for secrets.

```bash
cd server
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
# Edit .dev.vars to set your environment variables
```

#### Client

```bash
# nothing yet
```


### Development

```bash
# Run shared types in watch mode, server, and client all at once
bun run dev

# Or run individual parts
bun run dev:shared  # Watch and compile shared types
bun run dev:server  # Run the Hono backend
bun run dev:client  # Run the Vite dev server for React
```

### Building

```bash
# Build everything
bun run build

# Or build individual parts
bun run build:shared  # Build the shared types package
bun run build:client  # Build the React frontend
```

## Why bhvr?

While there are plenty of existing app building stacks out there, many of them are either bloated, outdated, or have too much of a vendor lock-in. bhvr is built with the opinion that you should be able to deploy your client or server in any environment while also keeping type safety.

## Features

- **Full-Stack TypeScript**: End-to-end type safety between client and server
- **Shared Types**: Common type definitions shared between client and server
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized as a workspaces-based monorepo
- **Modern Stack**:
  - [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the JavaScript runtime
  - [Hono](https://hono.dev) as the backend framework
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for frontend bundling
  - [React](https://react.dev) for the frontend UI

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ client/               # React frontend
â”œâ”€â”€ server/               # Hono backend
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/               # Shared TypeScript definitions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/types/        # Type definitions used by both client and server
â””â”€â”€ package.json          # Root package.json with workspaces
```

### Server

bhvr uses Hono as a backend API for its simplicity and massive ecosystem of plugins. If you have ever used Express then it might feel familiar. Declaring routes and returning data is easy.

```
server
â”œâ”€â”€ bun.lock
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

If you wanted to add a database to Hono you can do so with a multitude of Typescript libraries like [Supabase](https://supabase.com), or ORMs like [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started) or [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/orm)

### Client

bhvr uses Vite + React Typescript template, which means you can build your frontend just as you would with any other React app. This makes it flexible to add UI components like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) or routing using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/installation).

### Shared

The Shared package is used for anything you want to share between the Server and Client. This could be types or libraries that you use in both environments.

```
shared
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ types
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Inside the `src/index.ts` we export any of our code from the folders so it's usable in other parts of the monorepo

```typescript
export * from "./types"
```

By running `bun run dev` or `bun run build` it will compile and export the packages from `shared` so it can be used in either `client` or `server`

```typescript
import { ApiResponse } from 'shared'
```

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

You can start a new bhvr project using the [CLI](https://github.com/stevedylandev/create-bhvr)

```bash
bun create bhvr
```

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies for all workspaces
bun install
```

### Development

```bash
# Run shared types in watch mode, server, and client all at once
bun run dev

# Or run individual parts
bun run dev:shared  # Watch and compile shared types
bun run dev:server  # Run the Hono backend
bun run dev:client  # Run the Vite dev server for React
```

### Building

```bash
# Build everything
bun run build

# Or build individual parts
bun run build:shared  # Build the shared types package
bun run build:client  # Build the React frontend
```

### Deployment

Deplying each piece is very versatile and can be done numerous ways, and exploration into automating these will happen at a later date. Here are some references in the meantime.

- [Node.js](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/nodejs)

## Type Sharing

Types are automatically shared between the client and server thanks to the shared package and TypeScript path aliases. You can import them in your code using:

```typescript
import { ApiResponse } from 'shared/types';
```
